## Project setup 
1. Fork the current repository using your own Github account
2. Clone the forked repo to your workspace `git clone 
3. We're going to use Expo, if you do not have expo cli installed, install it now using `npm install --global expo-cli`
4. Initiate app using `expo init todoList`
    - Select a blank template (blank - a minimal app as clean as an empty canvas) - dependancies will now install
5. Move into created project `cd todoList`
    - Run `npm run start` to launch the expo project
